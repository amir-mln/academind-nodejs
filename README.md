# Node.js

This repo holds the source code and files of the udemy course [NodeJS The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/).

Despite the fact that the instructor teaches the course in `javascript`; I decided to use `typescript` after starting the 12th section of the course (`Working with NoSQL & Using MongoDB`).

The Instructor starts using `Mongoose` after finishing the 12th section; I won't. I'll keep using `mongodb-driver` with its own schema validation methods (Why? Cuz i'm thug).
