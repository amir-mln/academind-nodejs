# Node.js

This repo holds the source code and files of the udemy course [NodeJS The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/).

After starting the 12th section of the course (`Working with NoSQL & Using MongoDB`), i decided to use `typescript`; Despite the fact that the instructor teaches the course in `javascript`.
